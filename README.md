# Brazil-nut-effect
The initial/basic code is programmed as follows to investigate the brazil nut effect:
**1. Initial conditions.** In a two dimensional system, particles are set to have circular shapes and never overlap with each other.
**2. Equilibrium simulation after ‘pouring’** The Monte Carlo method was implemented to demonstrate the process of ‘pouring’, a
process of pouring particles into a container until they are settled by gravity.
**3. Shaking simulation** Particles are constantly lifted and settled throughout the process of shaking. The Monte Carlo method and the largest nearest neighbor distance are used to speed up this process.
